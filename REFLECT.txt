Impressions: Super fun and challenging assignment. I think some of the write-up wording could be improved. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Problem 1: How does doubling N affect the running time?
DFS: runtime quadruples (N^2)
Quick Find: increases by a factor of about 14 (N^4)
Weighted QUWPC: runtime doubles (N) 


Problem 2: How does doubling T affect the running time?
DFS: runtime appears to increase but not double (log T)
Quick Find: runtime doubles (T)
Weighted QUWPC: runtime appears to increase but not double (log T)

Problem 3: Measure running time (using calls to System.currentTimeMillis)
of the three versions of your program (DFS, Quick Find, and weighted quick
union with path compression). Use PercolationStats(80,40)
3A DFS: 532.0		
3B Quick Find: 676.0
3C Weighted quick union with path compression: 66.0

Problem 4: Give a formula (using Big-Oh notation) of the running time on your computer (in seconds) as a function of both N and T.
DFS: O(N^2 log T)
Quick Find: O(N^4 T)
Weighted QUWPC: O(N log T)

Problem 5: Estimate the largest experiment you could  perform in one
[minute, day, year] assuming your computer has enough memory.
// holding T constant at T=30, max's were calculated based on N approximations since N dominates all Big-Oh notations
For DFS...
5A 1 minute: N = ~750
5B 1 day: N = ~28000
5C 1 year: N = ~5e6

For QuickFind...
5A 1 minute: N = ~260
5B 1 day: N = ~1600
5C 1 year: N = ~7000

For Weighted QUWPC...
5A 1 minute: N = ~13000
5B 1 day: N = ~1e9
5C 1 year: N = ~4e11

Problem 6: Give a formula (using Big-Oh notation) that describes the amount
of memory (in bytes) that your IPercolate implementation consumes as a function of N.
6A DFS: O(N^2)
6B Quick Find: O(N^2)
6C Weighted quick union with path compression: O(N^2)
